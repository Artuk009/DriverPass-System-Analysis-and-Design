# DriverPass-System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  In this scenario, our client (DriverPass) wanted to create an application that would provide students who were taking their driver's test at the DMV with 
  learning materials and the ability to schedule driving lessons with an instructor. The application was to include varying packages to accomodate the 
  student's needs in additon to reservations that could be made either through the application or over the phone.

# What did you do particularly well?

  I did well at describing the requirements for the system including functional requirements, nonfucntional requirements, limitations, and 
  assumptions. My UML diagrams are also highly detailed and do well at describing the system without being overly complex.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would have included the use case and sequence diagrams for all of the use cases portrayed by the use case diagram but that was outside of the base 
  requirements for this particular project.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  We were provided with a transcript of the requirements interview between the DriverPass team and our systems analyst team which provided us with the 
  base requirments as defined by the DriverPass team's perception of how the user experience should be. It is important to consider the user's needs when 
  designing because they will be the one's interacting with the system the majority of the time, and the user's are the customers of our client. As such, 
  they need to be provided with the most fluid and efficient experience possible, so the system meets our client's expectations.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  In considering the approach to designing software, it is important to first gather what the requirements for the program will be as determined by the
  your client or members of the development team. Then you must think about which of these requirements fall under fuctional or nonfuctional, what the 
  limitations of the project are, and what assumptions can be made while navigating through the design process. Afterwards, it is a good idea to create 
  various UML diagrams to develop the blueprint for how the application will function at varying viewpoint levels. Finally, it is important to document as 
  much of the process as possible for your fellow developers and clients to make adjustments as needed in regards to updates and maintenance of the 
  software.
